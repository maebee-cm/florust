# Florust

## Like flora, or a florist, but like, y'know, with Rust

Florust was created to be a plant monitoring system, split into a client and server components. While Florust's intended use case by your's truly is to be a plant monitoring system, there's nothing stopping you from using it to log and visualize whatever data you'd like. The client and server work on a plugin system, which means you can write your own modules for it, to take data from any source you'd like go crazy!
