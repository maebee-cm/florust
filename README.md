# Florust

## Like flora, or a florist, but like, y'know, with Rust

Florust is an extendible, and easily modifiable data logging, and visualization system. With a flexible plugin system, Florust gives you the power to shape your data however you want!

Florust was created to be a plant monitoring system, split into a client and server components. While Florust's use case by your's truly is a plant monitoring system, there's nothing stopping you from using it to log and visualize whatever data you'd like. Take data from any source you'd want, shape it and modify it to your heart's content, go crazy!
