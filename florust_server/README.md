# Florust Server

## Like flora, or a florist, but like, y'know, with Rust

Florust was created to be a plant monitoring system, split into a client and server components. You're looking at the server! This server will take data collected from an arbitrary number of clients, and allow you to manage those clients, and visualize the data that they report through a web interface.
