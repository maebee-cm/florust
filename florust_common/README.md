# Florust Common

## Like flora, or a florist, but like, y'know, with Rust

Florust is an extendible, and easily modifiable data logging, and visualization system. With a flexible plugin system, Florust gives you the power to shape your data however you want! You're looking at the data source client! This client will use the plugins your provide to take data collected from an arbitrary number of sources, and send it to a Florust server.
