# Florust Common

## Like flora, or a florist, but like, y'know, with Rust

Florust is an extendible, and easily modifiable data logging, and visualization system. With a flexible plugin system, Florust gives you the power to shape your data however you want! You're looking at the common crate! This crate provides some generic common functionality needed by two or more parts of the Florust system, like the definition of client-to-server messages, server-to-client messages, and the FFI interface.
